The molecules.xyz file represents the xyz file for one molecule of methane, and to create more molecules; implement the command (after installing packmol):
packmol < mixture.inp.
This command generates the output.xyz which can be used to generate the lammps data file using the tcl file or running the commands in TKConsole in VMD and edit the datafile to include the pair coefficients from TraPPE.

For the MOF, convert the attached cif file to a LAMMPS data file using Lammps-Interface.

Run the all_lts.sh script to create a moletemplate enable LAMMPS Datafile.
